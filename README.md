# My Client v0.1.0

Base API built with the Guzzle framework (v6.2). Used to make PHP and AJAX requests to [MyAPI](https://github.com/dreboard/myapi) built with the Slim Framework v3

## Automation and provisioning

We will use as much automation as possible during provisioning so that our scripts can be used. Though it's important to note that some scripts rely on others, order of execution can be important and there are many setting changes that are designed for dev environments only.  

## Requirements

You can use this system on any computer that can run the following software, it's completely platform independent.

- [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)

#### The base box was built with virtualbox 5.1.18 / vagrant 1.9.2

## Components

- This will run the default webserver with the default php modules we need installed.
